Devito tutorials
================

Listed below are several sets of tutorials that will help you get
started with Devito. They are grouped around individual scientific
computing topics and gradually introduce the key concepts of the
Devito API through IPython notebooks. All notebooks can be found
by checking out our the repository on github_

Computational Fluid Dynamics
----------------------------

**COMING SOON:** A tutorial series that introduces the core features
of Devito through a set of classic examples from Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD). The series is based on the excellent tutorial blog
`CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes
<http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/>`_
by the Lorena A. Barba Group and focusses on the implementation with
Devito rather than pure CFD or finite difference theory.

Seismic Modelling and Inversion
-------------------------------

A set of tutorials that introduces some basic concepts of seismic
modelling and highlights how to use Devito operators to solve seismic
inversion problems.

* `01 - Introduction to seismic modelling
  <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/opesci/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/tutorials/test_01_modelling.ipynb>`_
